It is impossible to provide the exact vulnerable code from the Wattsense Bridge devices due to ethical and legal constraints. Providing the precise code would enable malicious actors to exploit the vulnerability in unpatched systems.

However, I can provide a Python code example that demonstrates a *similar* vulnerability in a hypothetical plugin manager. This example represents the *type* of vulnerability described in CVE-2025-26411 (unauthenticated or insufficiently authenticated file upload leading to remote code execution) without directly revealing any proprietary Wattsense code.  **This code is for educational and demonstration purposes ONLY and should not be used in a real-world environment without proper security review and hardening.**

```python
import os
import shutil
from flask import Flask, request, render_template, redirect, url_for
from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename

UPLOAD_FOLDER = 'plugins'
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'py'} # Only allow python files (naive security)

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = UPLOAD_FOLDER
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'some_secret_key' # Replace with a real secret key in production

def allowed_file(filename):
    return '.' in filename and \
           filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1].lower() in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS

@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
def index():
    plugins = []
    if os.path.exists(UPLOAD_FOLDER):
        plugins = os.listdir(UPLOAD_FOLDER)
    return render_template('index.html', plugins=plugins)

@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
    # check if the post request has the file part
    if 'file' not in request.files:
        return 'No file part'
    file = request.files['file']
    # If the user does not select a file, the browser submits an
    # empty file without a filename.
    if file.filename == '':
        return 'No selected file'
    if file and allowed_file(file.filename):
        filename = secure_filename(file.filename) # Basic sanitization
        file.save(os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename))
        return redirect(url_for('index'))
    else:
        return "Invalid file type. Only .py files allowed."

@app.route('/run_plugin/<filename>')
def run_plugin(filename):
    if filename.endswith('.py'):
        try:
            # WARNING: Executing arbitrary code is VERY DANGEROUS
            # This is the core vulnerability!
            plugin_path = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename)
            exec(open(plugin_path).read()) # Executes the plugin
            return f"Plugin '{filename}' executed successfully."
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Error executing plugin: {e}"
    else:
        return "Invalid plugin file."


@app.route('/delete_plugin/<filename>')
def delete_plugin(filename):
     if filename.endswith('.py'):
        try:
            plugin_path = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename)
            os.remove(plugin_path)
            return f"Plugin '{filename}' deleted successfully."
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Error deleting plugin: {e}"
     else:
        return "Invalid plugin file."

    if not os.path.exists(UPLOAD_FOLDER):
        os.makedirs(UPLOAD_FOLDER)

Key aspects making it vulnerable:

1.  **Insufficient Authentication/Authorization:** The provided example does not implement any authentication or authorization.  Anyone accessing the web application can upload and execute files.  CVE-2025-26411 states a *valid* user is needed, but in reality, the vulnerability boils down to the *rights* the authenticated user has.  If any authenticated user can upload and execute code, that's a vulnerability.

2.  **Unrestricted File Upload:**  While `allowed_extensions` attempts to restrict file types, this check is easily bypassed. A more robust approach would involve validating the file *content* and not just the extension.  Even allowing Python files is extremely dangerous.

3.  **`exec()` for Code Execution:** The most critical vulnerability is the use of `exec(open(plugin_path).read())`.  This directly executes the contents of the uploaded file as Python code. This gives the attacker complete control over the system.  The vulnerability mentions remote root access, this is achievable if the web server process itself has root privileges, or the uploaded code is written to exploit other vulnerabilities in the system to escalate privileges.

4.  **Inadequate Input Sanitization:**  While `secure_filename` is used, it's not sufficient. It primarily addresses filename-based path traversal, but it doesn't prevent malicious code from being uploaded within the file *content* itself.

**Important Disclaimer:**  This code is provided for educational purposes only. Do not deploy it in a real-world environment without addressing the security vulnerabilities described above.  Using this code without proper safeguards can lead to severe security breaches.  Real-world plugin systems require significantly more sophisticated security measures.
