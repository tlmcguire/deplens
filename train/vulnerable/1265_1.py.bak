# Example attack:
# In a real attack, the attacker would send a POST request to /process_request
# with a 'command' parameter containing malicious code.

# For example:
# POST /process_request HTTP/1.1
# Host: vulnerable_server:8000
# Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
# Content-Length: ...

# command=whoami

#  or
# command=rm -rf /tmp/*  (VERY DANGEROUS - DON'T RUN THIS!)

# The vulnerable server would then execute this command directly, leading to a compromise.

# This simplified example demonstrates the core vulnerability:  unsanitized user input being
# used directly in a command execution context.  The IBL Software Engineering Visual Weather
# product likely had a more complex system of "Message Editor Output Filters" that were intended
# to sanitize the input, but were ultimately bypassable, leading to the vulnerability.
