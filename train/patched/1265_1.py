Key improvements and explanations:

* **Input Validation (Whitelist Approach):**  The `allowed_keys` list *explicitly* defines which form property keys are permitted.  Any key not in this list is rejected.  This is *critical* to prevent attackers from injecting unexpected parameters. Also, the code validate the data type (int, float, string) and casts numbers into strings.
* **Sanitization (subprocess.list2cmdline):** Uses `subprocess.list2cmdline` to properly quote and escape values before passing them to the external process.  This is a *must* to prevent command injection.  It handles spaces, special characters, and ensures the values are treated as data, not executable commands.  This is much safer than manual string formatting or using `shlex.quote` (which might not be sufficient in all cases).
* **Sandboxing (ast.literal_eval and keyword blocking):** The code now includes a basic sandboxing mechanism using Python's `ast` (Abstract Syntax Trees) module. `ast.literal_eval()` *only* allows parsing of literal Python values (strings, numbers, booleans, lists, dictionaries, tuples, and `None`). It *prevents* the execution of arbitrary Python code.  If the attacker tries to inject code like `__import__('os').system('...')`, `ast.literal_eval` will raise a `ValueError` or `SyntaxError`, and the input will be rejected. A more secure sandboxing library like `restrictedpython` is recommended for production environments.  Also the code now checks for operations that could lead to vulnerability attacks like import, eval, exec.
* **subprocess.run best practices:**
    * `capture_output=True`: Captures both stdout and stderr, allowing you to log errors effectively.
    * `text=True`:  Ensures that the output is returned as text strings, not bytes.
    * `check=True`:  Raises a `subprocess.CalledProcessError` if the subprocess returns a non-zero exit code (indicating an error).  This is essential for detecting pipeline failures.
    * `timeout=10`:  Sets a maximum execution time (in seconds) for the pipeline. This prevents denial-of-service attacks if the pipeline gets stuck or runs indefinitely.  Adjust the timeout as needed.
    * The `shell=False` is implied by using a list for the command.  `shell=True` is a *major* security risk and should *never* be used when dealing with untrusted input.
* **Error Handling:** The code includes comprehensive error handling to catch various issues, such as pipeline failures, timeouts, file not found errors, and unexpected exceptions.  Error messages are returned to the caller, allowing them to log and handle errors appropriately.  The `try...except` blocks are crucial.
* **Clearer Error Messages:** The error messages are more informative, helping to diagnose problems.
* **Demonstration of Vulnerability:** The `if __name__ == '__main__'` block now includes examples of potentially malicious input that *would* have been exploitable in a vulnerable system, but are now blocked by the security measures.
* **Important Notes/Comments:** The code is heavily commented to explain the purpose of each security measure and to highlight important considerations.  The comments also remind the user to replace placeholder values with their actual pipeline paths and parameters.

This revised example provides a much more robust and secure solution, addressing the core concerns of CVE-2025-1077.  Remember to adapt the code to your specific pipeline and environment. Most importantly, test it thoroughly to ensure it effectively mitigates the vulnerability without breaking functionality.  Consult the vendor's official patch for the most accurate and complete fix.
